## üöÄ How It Works

1. Select a mathematical constant from the available list
2. Configure your training session (start position and number of digits)
3. Type the digits from memory as they're presented
4. Use arrow keys to skip digits or Backspace to correct mistakes
5. Review your performance metrics after each session
6. Track your improvement over time with detailed statistics
